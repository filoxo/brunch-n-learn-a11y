# Practice 1: Custom button

```jsx
import { handleKeyboardClick } from "./utils";

function CustomButton({ onClick, children }) {
  const onKeyDown = handleKeyboardClick(onClick);
  return (
    <button role="button" tabindex="0" onClick={onClick} onKeyDown={onKeyDown}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Appear>

\* What about `aria-pressed`?

</Appear>

# Practice 2: Forms

```jsx
function MyForm() {
  const handleUsername = (e) => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const handlePassword = (e) => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Do the thing
  };
  return (
    <form submit={handleSubmit}>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
      <input id="username" onChange={handleUsername} />
      <label>
        <span>Password</span>
        <input onChange={handlePassword} type="password" />
      </label>
      <div>
        <button type="button">Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

1. Why doesn't the second label need `htmlFor`?
1. What benefits does an associated label provide?
1. What is the default `button` type?

# Practice 3: CSS-in-JS

```jsx
const CustomButton = styled.button`
  background: lightgrey;
  ${({ width = "auto", isDisabled = false, isPressed }) => {
    let styles = `width: ${width};`;
    if (disabled) styles += "opacity: 0.6; ";
    if (isPressed) styles += "background: darkgrey;";
    return style;
  }}
`;
```

```jsx
const OtherCustomButton = styled.button`
  background: lightgrey;
  ${({ width = "auto" }) => `width: ${width};`}
  :disabled {
    opacity: 0.6;
  }
  &[aria-pressed="true"] {
    background: darkgrey;
  }
`;
```
